# Web-based Flight Simulator

## Overview
The **Web-based Flight Simulator** is an interactive application that allows users to experience realistic aircraft control and flight dynamics. The simulator incorporates **aerodynamic principles, real-world physics, and immersive visuals** to provide an educational and engaging experience.

---

## Objective
- Develop an **interactive 3D flight simulator**.
- Implement **realistic aerodynamics and flight mechanics**.
- Provide **multi-view perspectives** including cockpit, third-person, and instrument views.
- Enable users to **take off, land, and perform flight maneuvers**.

---

## Scientific Principles Applied
The simulator is built on fundamental **aerodynamics and physics equations**:

### **1. Lift Equation (Aerodynamics)**
$$ L = C_L \times \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S $$
Where:
- **L** = Lift force
- **C_L** = Lift coefficient
- **\rho** = Air density
- **V** = Aircraft velocity
- **S** = Wing area

### **2. Drag Equation**
$$ D = C_D \times \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S $$
Where:
- **D** = Drag force
- **C_D** = Drag coefficient

### **3. Angular Motion (Aircraft Rotation)**
$$ T = I \times \alpha $$
Where:
- **T** = Torque
- **I** = Moment of inertia
- **\alpha** = Angular acceleration

### **4. Thrust Equation**
$$ T = m \times a $$
Where:
- **T** = Thrust
- **m** = Aircraft mass
- **a** = Acceleration

### **5. Newton‚Äôs Second Law (Aircraft Motion)**
$$ F = m \times a $$
Where:
- **F** = Net force acting on the aircraft
- **a** = Acceleration

### **6. Bernoulli‚Äôs Principle (Pressure Difference for Lift)**
$$ P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V_2^2 $$
